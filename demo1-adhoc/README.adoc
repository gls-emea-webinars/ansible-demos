== Demo 1 Using Ad-Hoc commands

.Show our prep work
----
First we need to show that we made sure we can access the managed nodes using ssh without using a password. For this we need to have SSH-keys distributed. Also we need to have the managed nodes listed. We list our (static) managed nodes in an inventory file called 'myservers' in the folder 'inventory/'. 
In our ansible.cfg we describe which credentials we use and where to find the inventory files.
